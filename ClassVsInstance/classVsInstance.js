/* Task

  Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer
  ,initialAge, as a parameter. The constructor must assign  to  after confirming the argument passed as  is 
  not negative; if a negative argument is passed as , the constructor should set  to  and print 
  Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance 
  methods:

yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by .
amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
If , print You are young..
If  and , print You are a teenager..
Otherwise, print You are old..
To help you learn by example and complete this challenge, much of the code is provided for you, 
but you'll be writing everything in the future. The code that creates each instance of your 
Person class is in the main method. Don't worry if you don't understand it all quite yet!

Note: Do not remove or alter the stub code in the editor.

Input Format

Input is handled for you by the stub code in the editor.

The first line contains an integer,  (the number of test cases), and the  subsequent lines each
contain an integer denoting the  of a Person instance.

Constraints

Output Format

Complete the method definitions provided in the editor so they meet the specifications outlined 
above; the code to test your work is already in the editor. If your methods are implemented 
correctly, each test case will print 
or  lines (depending on whether or not a valid  was passed to the constructor).
