## Hello dear developer

If you are here maybe it is because you are trying to learn a bit of pure JavaScript. Thanks for letting me guide you. You must have node installed.
To open a file, in the console go to the project file and in the terminal type `node <name_file>.js`
Some of this exercises are tests that I hace had in interviews, so I hope they serve you.
